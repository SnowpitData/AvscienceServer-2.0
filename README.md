# AvscienceServer-2.0
New version of snow pilot data services, JSON and XML. 

This is the newest version of the snow pilot data services.
These data services will run on a J2EE server such as Tomcat and access the snow pilot MySQL DB.
The data services abstract the snow pilot db and data model, 
and produce and consume xml and json documents to interface various clients with the snow pilot 
database. 

These data services use the Snow Pilot Data Objects library, which are a java implmenetation of the the snow pilot data model.
